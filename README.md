# ✈️ Flight Ticket Price EDA

## 📌 Project Overvie
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of flight ticket price data to understand the factors affecting airfare pricing.  
The goal is to analyze, clean, and visualize the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and insights about ticket prices.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical features into usable formats
   - Extracted new features (day, month, duration, etc.)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Univariate analysis of categorical & numerical variables
   - Bivariate analysis (impact of airline, stops, duration, etc. on price)
   - Outlier detection and treatment
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Distribution plots of ticket prices
   - Boxplots for airline & stops analysis
   - Heatmaps for correlation
   - Trend analysis based on journey month/day
